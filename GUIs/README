# GUI Utilities

This folder contains the Tkinter based graphical front end for the toolkit.

## Scripts

- **GUI_main.py** – small launcher window that opens the individual tools.
- **asteroid_detection_window.py** – runs the FITS asteroid detection routine.
- **quick_eph_window.py** – displays asteroid ephemerides and observable objects.
- **platesolver_window.py** – wrapper around Astrometry.net or local plate solving.
- **pwi4_client.py** – optional client for communicating with PlaneWave mounts.

## Required data

Several scripts rely on external data files placed in `Utilities`:

- `mpcorb_df.pkl` – Minor Planet Center orbital catalogue used by the ephemeris tool.
- `astorb.dat` and `MPCORB.dat` – orbit databases read by the printing utilities.
- `de421.bsp` – JPL ephemeris for Sun/Earth positions.

Follow the steps in [../DATA_PREPARATION.md](../DATA_PREPARATION.md) to obtain these files and copy them into `GUIs/Utilities`.

## Usage

Run the launcher from this directory:

```bash
python GUI_main.py
```

This opens the main menu where the above tools can be accessed.
