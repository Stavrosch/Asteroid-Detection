1 Track Asteroid / Observable Objects
    Provides two tabs:

        “Whats Observable?” – queries JPL’s service for observable asteroids given location, date/time, elevation limit, magnitude range, and object type.

        “Track Asteroid” – displays ephemeris data for a specified asteroid and plots its altitude path.
2 Plate Solver

    Plate Solves FITS images via Astrometry.net or a local installation of Astrometry.net.

    If using Astrometry.net, set your API key in GUIs/Utilities/ps_API.py around line 21.
    The local solve requires to locally install astrometry.net independently.

3 Asteroid Detection

    Select a FITS file and magnitude threshold.

    Runs detection (calls functions in Utilities/detector.py), marking possible asteroids and allowing generation of an MPC-formatted report.

    If no asteroid is found lower the threshold if there are too many detections do the opposite. 
    Use the report button to generate an 80 collumn format report.
